# Image_Colorization
 The objective of this project is to serve as an experimental study on how the most basic auto-encoder performs
 against image colorization. This auto-encoder model is implemented with higher-level or more complicated method
ologies to solve image colorization with excellent results. An image colorization is a tool that uses AI to add color to black and white photos.
